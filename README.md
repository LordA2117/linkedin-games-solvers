# LinkedIn Puzzle Solvers

A collection of solvers for the various puzzles on LinkedIn. Obviously, these still need a functional UI to be viable even, so I will do exactly that in the coming future. For now I just want the logic out of the way

## TODOS
- [ ] Add solver for zip
- [ ] Add good interfaces for the solvers
- [ ] Develop a web interface for the solver using flask, or see if you can pull something off using qt-designer

## Personal Note

Check out [this article](https://medium.com/@mvenkatashivaditya/linkedin-zip-puzzle-solver-python-953be08daab3) on how to solve the zip puzzle if you prefer the recursive methods.
